###Minimum Viable Product
Killer Square begins with a board that displays a red square at the top.  At the bottom, there are three boxes displaying a score board, a start button, and a level indicator.  When the player clicks the start button, the red square will begin to move from the top of the board towards the bottom of the board.  If the user can click on the Killer Square before it reaches the bottom of the board, the game will re-load and move into level two.  In level two, the Killer Square will appear in a random position on the top of the board and will move to the bottom of the board more quickly than in level one.  With every subsequent level, the speed of the Killer Square will increase.  If the user cannot click on the Killer Square before it reaches the bottom of the board, the game will end.   

###Stretch Goals
If I can finish the minimum viable product by Wednesday 10/12, I will work on increasing the game's complexity and style.  The first step will be to give the game a Star Wars theme where the Killer Box will be replaced with a TIE Fighter.  The board's background will have a space gif which will simulate space flight.  

If I have more time to make improvements, I will work on giving the TIE Fighter increasingly complex movement patterns across the board.     
  
###Technologies Used
To render and style the game board, I will use HTML and CSS.  

To move the Killer Square, track score, and track level, I will use Javascript.
